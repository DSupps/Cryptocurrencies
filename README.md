# Cryptocurrencies Analysis

##  Cryptocurrencies Analysis Project Overview:
*Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. To help them, a report will be created that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.*

*The original data we will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are  looking for, we have decided to use unsupervised learning.*


### Technicals used in this project to classify cryptocurrencies:
- Preprocessed data for model using pandas and sklearn library to standardize features
- Reduced data dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Performed clustering using K-Means
- Visualized results in 2-D and 3-D using hvplot

### Deliverables:
- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
