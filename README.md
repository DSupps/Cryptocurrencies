# Cryptocurrencies Analysis

##  Cryptocurrencies Analysis Project Overview:
*It’s time to put all these skills to use by creating an analysis for your clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.*

*Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.*

*The data Martha will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, she has decided to use unsupervised learning.*
